# Airbnb Clone Project 🌟

## Welcome to the Airbnb Clone Project 🏠

Collaborators: Collins 👨‍💻 and David Ooko 👨‍💻

🚀 **Let's Build Something Amazing!** 🚀

### Project Overview 📝

The Airbnb Clone project is a fantastic opportunity for Collins and David to embark on a coding adventure. 🌍 Our goal is to create a simplified version of the Airbnb website. Over the course of a year, we'll work together to cover essential concepts of higher-level programming.

🌱 **Our Project Goals:**

1. Develop a Command Interpreter: Create a command-line tool for data manipulation, perfect for development and debugging.
2. Craft a Stunning Website: Build a front-end that showcases our work, featuring both static and dynamic elements.
3. Implement Data Storage: Develop a storage system for persisting data, with support for both file and database storage.
4. Create a RESTful API: Establish a communication interface between the front-end and our data, enabling actions like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects.
5. Unit Testing: Collaborate closely on creating robust unit tests and test cases.

### Project Stages 📅

1. **The Console 🖥️**
   - Develop a command interpreter.
   - Create data models for objects.
   - Implement object operations via the command interpreter.
   - Store objects to a file using JSON.

2. **Web Static 🌐**
   - Learn HTML and CSS for web development.
   - Craft the HTML structure of our application.
   - Create templates for object representation.

3. **MySQL Storage 🗄️**
   - Replace file-based storage with a database.
   - Map data models to database tables using ORM.

4. **Web Framework and Templating 🛠️**
   - Build a Python web server.
   - Make static HTML dynamic by integrating data.

5. **RESTful API 🚀**
   - Expose objects via a JSON-based REST API.
   - Enable CRUD operations through the API.

6. **Web Dynamic 🌟**
   - Learn jQuery for client-side enhancements.
   - Interact with our custom REST API to load objects on the client side.

7. **Files and Directories 📂**
   - Organize the project into specific directories.
   - Set up the essential project structure.

8. **Serialization/Deserialization 🧩**
   - Implement object serialization to JSON.
   - Deserialize JSON to recreate object instances.

9. **Flexibility with *args and **kwargs 🧐**
   - Learn how to use these in function definitions for flexible argument handling.

10. **Working with Datetime ⏰**
    - Utilize Python's datetime module for date and time manipulation.
    - Format and display date and time information.

### Why Separate Storage Management? 📦

Separating storage management from data models ensures our models are modular and independent. This architecture allows us to easily switch storage systems without rewriting our entire codebase. Plus, it ensures that class attributes are consistently used for object attributes.

### How to Store Instances? 📥

To store instances, we'll convert them into serializable data structures, such as dictionaries. Then, we'll serialize this data to a string, typically in JSON format. When loading instances, we'll deserialize the string, convert it back to a data structure, and recreate instances from this data.

🌟 **Let's Make Magic Happen!** 🪄

The Airbnb Clone project is a fantastic journey into web development, data management, and software engineering. With Collins and David as the two fearless contributors, we'll work diligently to create our own version of Airbnb.

👏 **Collaboration is Key!** 👏

Enjoy the adventure! 🚁
